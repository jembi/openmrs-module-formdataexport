For information information about this module see the [Form Data Export module wiki page](https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/Form+Data+Export).

Installation

To install the Form Data Export module, download the right version from the [module download page](https://modules.openmrs.org/modules/view.jsp?module=formdataexport) and follow the installation instructions on the [Administering Modules wiki page](https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/Administering+Modules).

Configuration
-------------

The Form Data Export module is configured using [global properties](https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/Global+Properties+Descriptions). To change the values of the global properties, go the the *Administration* page, then, under the *Maintenance* heading, click *Settings*. Finally, click the *Formdataexport* item on the menu on the left. The four available global properties are described below.

`Patient Identifier Types` A comma-separated list of patient identifier types by identifier name that you want to include in your data exports.

`Person Address Columns` A comma-separated list of person address columns by name and the titles that you want to use for the columns. Each element of the list should be of the form "title=addressColumn", where title is the title and addressColumn is one of: address1, address2, address3, address4, address5, address6, cityVillage, countyDistrict, stateProvince, country, postalCode, latitude or longitude.

`Person Attribute Types` A comma-separated list of person attribute types by name and the titles that you want to use for the columns. Each element of the list should be of the form "title=personAttributeType", where title is the title and personAttributeType is the name of the person attribute type. You may also include the following four special attribute types: age, gender, givenName and familyName.

`Skip Columns With Suffix` A comma-separated list of column suffixes to skip. If there are any exceptions, add a pipe symbol and then list the exceptions. For example "_DATE,_PARENT" and "_DATE,_PARENT|TRANSFER_IN_DATE" are both valid.
